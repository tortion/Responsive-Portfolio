                I was born and raised in New York but have been in New Jersey since 1999.  My wife Stacy and I have 5 children and live in the hills overlooking the Wachung Reservation.

                    I have a desk job but spend much of my spare time staying active, playing or listening to music, and eating expensive food.  I spend 95% of my discretionary income on food that I am too lazy and disorganized to make myself.

                My favorite state is California, my favorite movie is 'The Big Lebowski', and my favorite pasttime is watching or playing Ice Hockey.
